## Overview

### The project
This is a clone of Tetris. It's a game. Maybe you've heard of it?

## My process

### Built with
- React.js
  - Hooks, including custom hooks

### What I learned
I loved this project, because it helped me get much more comfortable with React hooks. Because I'm not very comfortable building games yet, I leaned on several tutorials for this one, but I made it my own, as well.

### Continued development
Right now, I'm working on a portfolio and blog, constructed as a Single Page Application with Router and several hooks, and using Wordpress as a headless CMS.

## Acknowledgments
I copied a lot of the structure and some code verbatim from Weibenfalk's tutorial. I probably wouldn't have finished this without his help.
